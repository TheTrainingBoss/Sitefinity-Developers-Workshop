************************************************************************************

The Telerik.DataAccess.Fluent NuGet package is designed for projects containing
classes that are stored using Telerik Data Access. It can be utilized for defining
your data access model using the code-only Fluent Mapping.

It provides the assembly references and project enhancements made by the 
Telerik Data Access Enhancer tool during the build process, required by 
Telerik Data Access runtime.

If you need a NuGet package for a project only consuming Telerik Data Access model
from another assembly, the Telerik.DataAccess.Core NuGet package which contains the 
Telerik Data Access runtime assemblies necessary to work with Telerik Data Access
persistent objects is sufficient and can be used instead.

Telerik Data Access helps defining mapping and executing create, retrieve, 
update and delete operations for your data access classes and database tables. 
It allows you to consume stored procedures and functions.
