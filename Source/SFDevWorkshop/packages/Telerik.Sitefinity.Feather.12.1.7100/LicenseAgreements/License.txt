1.10.1.2.	Exceptions.  We will not indemnify you to the extent that the alleged infringement or misappropriation results from (a) use of the Product in combination with any other software or item not supplied by us; (b) failure to promptly implement an Update provided by us pursuant to 1.10.1.3 (Our Options); (c) modification of the Product not made or provided by us; or (d) use of the Product in a manner not permitted by this EULA. We also will not indemnify you if we notify you of our decision to terminate this EULA, and the license to the Product granted hereunder, in accordance with section 1.10.1.3 (Our Options) and you have not ceased all use of the Product within thirty (30) days of such notification. 
1.10.1.3.	Our Options.  If a final injunction is, or we reasonably believe that it could be, obtained against your use of the Product, or if in our opinion the Product is likely to become the subject of a successful claim of infringement, we may, at our option and expense, (a) replace or modify the Product so that it becomes non-infringing (provided that the functionality is substantially equivalent), (b) obtain for you a license to continue to use the Product, or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) are reasonably practicable, terminate this EULA on thirty (30) days’ notice and, if the Product was licensed to you on a Perpetual License or Term License basis, refund to you the license fee paid to us for the Product less an amount for depreciation determined on a straight-line five year (or actual term if shorter) depreciation basis with a commencement date as of the date of delivery of the Product, or if the Product was licensed to you on a Subscription License basis, refund to you the unused portion of the fees paid in advance to us for the then-current subscription period for the Product. THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS SET OUT IN THIS SECTION 1.10.1 STATE OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY INFRINGEMENT OR ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT BY US OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN RESPECT OF THE PRODUCT OR ITS USE.
1.10.2.	Your Indemnification Obligation.
1.10.2.1.	Indemnification for Third Party-Claims.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, you will defend us and our Affiliates, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all third party claims, lawsuits, and proceedings that arise or result from (a) your breach of this EULA, (b) your use, distribution and/or licensing of the Redistributables, if applicable, except to the extent it arises from an IP Claim covered under section 1.10.1 above, or (c) your failure or alleged failure to comply with Applicable Laws or any violation of a third party’s rights in connection with your use of the Product (each a “Third-Party Claim” and collectively “Third-Party Claims”) and you will indemnify for damages finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to any Third-Party Claim. 
1.10.3.	Control of the Defense or Settlement. For any indemnification obligation covered in section 1.10.1,“Indemnifying Party” means us, “Indemnified Party” means you, and “Claim” means an IP Claim. For any indemnification obligation covered in section 1.10.2, “Indemnifying Party” means you, “Indemnified Party” means us, and “Claim” means a Third-Party Claim. The Indemnified Party must provide the Indemnifying Party with prompt written notice of a Claim; however, the Indemnified Party’s failure to provide or delay in providing such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this section except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by the Indemnified Party’s failure or delay. The Indemnified Party will give the Indemnifying Party full control of the defense and settlement of the Claim as long as such settlement does not include a financial obligation on or admission of liability by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party does not do so, then the Indemnified Party waives the Indemnifying Party’s indemnification obligations under section 1.10.1 or 1.10.2, as applicable. The Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate in the defense of the Claim and may appear, at its own expense, through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party.
1.11.	Confidentiality.  
1.11.1.	Confidentiality Obligations.  Except as otherwise provided herein, each party agrees to retain in confidence all information and know-how transmitted or disclosed to the other that the disclosing party has identified as being proprietary and/or confidential or should reasonably  be  understood  to  be  confidential  given  the  nature  of  the  information  and  the  circumstances surrounding its disclosure, and agrees to make no use of such information and know-how except under the terms of this EULA. However, neither party will have an obligation to maintain the confidentiality of information that (a) it received rightfully from a third party without an obligation to maintain such information in confidence; (b) was known to the receiving party prior to its disclosure by the disclosing party; (c) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the confidential information of the disclosing party. Further, either party may disclose confidential information of the other party as required by governmental or judicial order, provided such party gives the other party prompt written notice prior to such disclosure (unless such prior notice is not permitted by applicable law) and complies with any protective order (or equivalent) imposed on such disclosure. You will treat any source code for the Product as our confidential information and will not disclose, disseminate or distribute such materials to any third party without our prior written permission. Each party’s obligations under this section 1.11 will apply during the term of this EULA and for five (5) years following termination of this EULA, provided, however, that (i) obligations with respect to source code will survive forever and (ii) trade secrets will be maintained as such until they fall into the public domain.
1.11.2.	Product Benchmark Results.  You acknowledge that any benchmark results pertaining to the Product are our confidential information and may not be disclosed or published without our prior written consent. This provision applies regardless of whether the benchmark tests are conducted by you or us.
1.11.3.	Remedies for Breach of Confidentiality Obligations.  Each party acknowledges that in the event of a breach or threat of breach of this section 1.11, money damages will not be adequate.

a.	You must register all domains (whether or not used for a Production Purpose) with us. You may not change your Production Domain designation(s) once registered. You are also required to register subdomains (i.e. by registering a license key for the Sitefinity Package for the Production Domain mysite.com, you will also be able to register and use it for all subdomains - www.mysite.com, support.mysite.com, staging.mysite.com, etc.). There is no limitation to the number of subdomains within a registered Production Domain on which you may install and use the Sitefinity Package for Development Purposes. You may purchase the right to use the Standard, Professional, Online Marketing or Enterprise Editions of the Sitefinity Package on more than one Production Domain and/or one or more subdomains for Production Purposes (“Domain Add-ons”); please contact us at sales@Sitefinity.com <mailto:sales@Sitefinity.com> if you wish to do so.
b.	If you purchase a license to use the Sitefinity Package in connection with Domain Add-on(s) on or after the date that you agree to this EULA, you may use the Sitefinity Package to administer such Domain Add-on(s) pursuant to the same terms, conditions and restrictions of this EULA applicable to the Production Domain which was initially designated by you at the time you registered a license key for the Sitefinity Package (the ”Primary Domain”), provided the Domain Add-on(s) are administered: (i) with the same edition of the Sitefinity Package as the Primary Domain; and (ii) for the same entity or individual that benefits from your administration of the Primary Domain. For example, if you have previously purchased a Standard Edition License and a Professional Edition License, you may not purchase an additional domain license at the Standard Edition price point and then administer the Domain Add-on(s) with the Professional Edition of the Sitefinity Package. Similarly, if you currently administer the Primary Domain for Company X, you may not administer any Domain Add-on(s) for Company Y; the administration of a Production Domain for Company Y requires a separate Primary Domain and thus the purchase of an additional Sitefinity License will be necessary.
3.4.3.3.	Administrative Use Limited to CMS Users.  At no time may the Sitefinity Package be (i) used for administrative/content management purposes by anyone other than CMS Users or (ii) used simultaneously by more than the number of CMS Users permitted to use the Sitefinity Package at any given time under the License for the edition of the Sitefinity Package you purchased.

3.4.3.5.	Limitations on Use and Distribution of add-on Modules.

If you want to use an add-on module that you have created through use of the Sitefinity Package to administer a publicly viewable website, you may only do so if such website is developed and administered with Sitefinty. You may distribute add-on modules that you create by using the Sitefinity Package, provided however, that (a) you may only distribute such add-on modules to third parties that agree to use such add-on modules in conjunction with Sitefinity pursuant to a valid Sitefinity license obtained by such third parties from us or an Authorized Reseller, and (b) you do not distribute such add-on modules on terms that make Sitefinty subject to a license that requires (i) the source code for Sitefinity to be disclosed or distributed; (ii) Sitefinity to be licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or (iii) Sitefinty to be redistributable without charge.
3.4.4.	Trademarks and Branding.

Any goodwill accruing from your use of your own trademarks will accrue to and be owned by you. Any goodwill accruing from our placement of our trademarks, logos, tag lines or other branding of ours on the Sitefinity Package, or from your placement of the Sitefinity® logo on the footers of web pages created using the Sitefinity Package, will accrue to and be owned by us. 
3.4.4.4.	Quality Control.  We reserve the right to review your website and add-on modules you create using the Sitefinity Package to ensure your compliance with the terms of this section 3.4.4.4; your breach of this section will be grounds for our termination of this EULA and the License granted to you hereunder.
3.4.5.	Support.
3.4.5.1.	Support Eligibility.  The level of support (if any) that you receive for the Sitefinity Package depends on which edition of the Sitefinity Package you select at the time of License purchase (the “Licensed Edition”).  To be eligible for support (including but not limited to support under a Mission Critical Support Add-on): (i) your use of the Sitefinity Package must be in full compliance with the terms of this EULA; (ii) you must provide all information and evidence necessary for our support personnel to adequately understand your support issue and diagnose the cause of such issue; and (iii) in the case of multiple Licenses, the Production Domain for which you are requesting support must be eligible for the level of support requested.

As part of your License you are entitled to the Support Package, identified for the Licensed Edition, and described in greater detail at https://www.progress.com/support/sitefinity-support-plans. You are entitled to receive support while you maintain an active Subscription, or, in the case of perpetual Licenses, for one (1) year after you purchase the License for the Sitefinity Package.

Our goal is to provide an initial response (but not necessarily a resolution) to each support inquiry within: (i) forty-eight (48) hours for the Standard Edition; or (ii) twenty-four (24) hours for all other editions, of receipt of such support inquiry, and we will use reasonable efforts to resolve the issue generating the inquiry as soon as is reasonably possible. You are responsible for backing up copies of all your data and software prior to seeking support from us. In the case of perpetual Licenses you will lose the right to receive support after such one (1) year period, unless you purchase additional support from us at additional cost. In the case of Subscriptions you will lose the right to receive support at the end of your Subscription, unless you renew your Subscription with us at additional cost. You are eligible to receive all Updates to the Licensed Edition of the Sitefinity Package while you maintain an active Subscription, or, in the case of perpetual Licenses, during the one (1) year period commencing on the date on which you purchase the License for the Licensed Edition of the Sitefinity Package; in the case of perpetual Licenses you will lose the right to receive Updates after such one (1) year period, unless you purchase additional maintenance from us at additional cost. In the case of Subscriptions you will lose the right to receive Updates at the end of your Subscription, unless you renew your Subscription with us at additional cost. The support of Add-on (s) (if purchased) and all access to support under the Mission Critical Support Add-on (if purchased) will be bound to the support term of the Licensed Edition Sitefinity Package License for which it is purchased, so that it becomes renewable at the same time as the renewal of the support term for the Licensed Edition Sitefinity Package License regardless of when the Add-on was purchased.
3.4.5.3.	Mission Critical Support. Our Mission Critical Support Add-on may be available as an option for an additional fee for certain Licensed Editions of the Sitefinity Package.

If you purchase a Mission Critical Support Add-on in connection with your License you are entitled to the Mission Critical Support Package described in greater detail at https://www.progress.com/support/sitefinity-support-plans. You will be entitled to receive support for an unlimited number of support inquiries. Our goal is to provide an initial response (but not necessarily a resolution) to each support inquiry within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt of such support inquiry and we will use reasonable efforts to resolve the issue generating the inquiry as soon as is reasonably possible.  Unless you purchase additional Mission Critical Support Add-on support from us at additional cost, you will lose the right to receive support under a Mission Critical Support Add-on at the end of the sooner of: one (1) year from the purchase of the Mission Critical Support Add-on; and (ii) the expiration of the support term of the particular Licensed Edition Sitefinity Package License for which the Mission Critical Support Add-on was purchased.

If it is determined by us in our sole discretion that you have received support from us for which you were not eligible, we may assess, and you agree to pay reasonable and appropriate fees for such support.
3.4.5.5.	Support Incidents. A single support incident (including but not limited to Mission Critical Support incidents) may involve several communications and offline work in order to be resolved. You agree to provide us with detailed information about the issue encountered and cooperate with our requests for additional information as we attempt to resolve the issue. Our support engineers will make reasonable efforts to resolve your support issues; however, we do not guarantee that all support issues will be resolved. Bug reports and product feature suggestions are not considered support incidents, and we are not obligated to acknowledge or address such bug reports and/or product feature suggestions.
3.4.5.6.	Product Discontinuance.  We reserve the right to discontinue at any time any component of the Sitefinity Package, whether or not it is offered as a standalone product or solely as a component of the Sitefinity Package.

The Ucommerce for Sitefinity Add-on is only available for purchase under a Subscription license model. If you hold licenses for multiple Sitefinity Package Editions, you may only use the Ucommerce for Sitefinity Add-on for a Production Purpose in conjunction with the Sitefinity Package edition for which you purchased the Ucommerce for Sitefinity Add-on. For example, if you have previously purchased a Sitefinity Package Professional Edition License and a Sitefinity Package Enterprise Edition License, and you purchase a Ucommerce for Sitefinity Add-on for use with the Sitefinity Package Professional Edition License, you may not use that Ucommerce for Sitefinity Add-on License in conjunction with the Sitefinity Package Enterprise Edition License. The Ucommerce for Sitefinity Add-on License is not available to purchase for use with the Sitefinity Package Standard Edition. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this EULA, if you intend to purchase a production license to the Ucommerce for Sitefinity Add-on to use in conjunction with our Sitefinity Cloud Platform as a Service offering, then your production license to the Ucommerce for Sitefinity Add-on will be governed by the terms and conditions of the then-applicable end-user license agreement for our Sitefinity Cloud Platform as a Service offering and not this EULA.
b.	Co-termination with Maintenance and Support Period or Subscription Period for Sitefinity Package Edition.  Unless otherwise specified in the Order, the period of your Subscription to the Ucommerce for Sitefinity Add-on will, at the time of purchase, be pro-rated, as necessary, to co-terminate with the then-current maintenance and support period for the Sitefinity Package edition (if a perpetual license) or then-current Subscription period for the Sitefinity Package edition (if a subscription license).
4.3.2.2.	Domain License Model. If you hold a valid license to Sitefinity Online Marketing Edition, Sitefinity Professional Edition or Sitefinity Enterprise Edition, then you may only purchase a License for the Ucommerce for Sitefinity Add-on under a Domain license model, in which case we grant you, while you have an active Subscription, a limited, non-transferable, revocable, non-exclusive License to, and to allow your Authorized Users to install and use the Ucommerce for Sitefinity Add-on, and any Updates thereto provided to you by us, in accordance with the Documentation and subject to the following limitations: 
a.	Domain Registration.  The Production Domain designated by you at the time you register a license key for the Ucommerce for Sitefinity Add-on must be the Primary Domain for the Sitefinity Package. You must register all domains (whether or not used for a Production Purpose) with us. You may not change your Production Domain designation(s) once registered. You are also required to register subdomains (i.e. by registering a license key for the Ucommerce for Sitefinity Add-on for the Production Domain mysite.com, you will also be able to register and use it for all subdomains - www.mysite.com, support.mysite.com, staging.mysite.com, etc.). There is no limitation to the number of subdomains within the Production Domain on which you may install and use the Ucommerce for Sitefinity Add-on for Development Purposes. You may purchase the right to use the Ucommerce for Sitefinity Add-on on more than one Production Domain and/or one or more subdomains for Production Purposes (“Ucommerce for Sitefinity Domain Add-ons”); provided that for each Ucommerce for Sitefinity Domain Add-on purchased, you must have a corresponding Domain Add-on license for the applicable Sitefinity Package edition; please contact us at sales@Sitefinity.com <mailto:sales@Sitefinity.com> if you wish to purchase a Ucommerce for Sitefinity Domain Add-on.
b.	Limitations on Domain Add-ons.  If you purchase a license to use the Ucommerce for Sitefinity Add-on on one or more Ucommerce for Sitefinity Domain Add-on(s) on or after the date that you agree to this EULA, you may use the Ucommerce for Sitefinity Add-on to administer such Ucommerce for Sitefinity Domain Add-on(s) pursuant to the same terms, conditions and restrictions of this EULA applicable to the Primary Domain, provided the Ucommerce for Sitefinity Domain Add-on(s) are administered for the same entity or individual that benefits from your administration of the Primary Domain. For example, if you currently administer the Primary Domain for Company X, you may not use the UCommerce for Sitefinity Add-on in connection with the administration of any Ucommerce for Sitefinity Domain Add-on(s) for Company Y; the administration of a Production Domain for Company Y requires a separate Primary Domain and thus the purchase of an additional License to the UCommerce for Sitefinity Add-on will be necessary.

If you hold a valid license to Sitefinity Professional Server Edition or Sitefinity Enterprise Server Edition, then you may only purchase a License for the Ucommerce for Sitefinity Add-on under a Server license model, in which case we grant you while you have an active Subscription, a limited, non-transferable, revocable, non-exclusive License to, and to allow your Authorized Users to install and use the Ucommerce for Sitefinity Add-on, and any Updates thereto provided to you by us, in accordance with the Documentation and subject to the following limitations:

There is no limit on the number of Production Domains on the Licensed Server; however, each Production Domain on the Licensed Server must be administered for the same entity or individual and you must register all domains and subdomains (regardless of whether or not such domains and subdomains are used for a Production Purpose) with us. You may purchase the right to install, use and access the Ucommerce for Sitefinity Add-on on additional Production Servers for an additional fee; provided that a pre-requisite to such purchase is that you hold an active license for the applicable Sitefinity Package edition on each additional Production Server on which you intend to install, use and access the Ucommerce for Sitefinity Add-on.
