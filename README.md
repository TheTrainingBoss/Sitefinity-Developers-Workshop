Developing in Sitefinity
========================

Using only the Sitefinity Administration Backend you can do many things,
but what if you need to work with your Sitefinity data programmatically?
For example, convert records in an Oracle database to a set of blog
posts, or create pages in a user interface you build in a Windows form
or WPF? The Sitefinity API can help with one-time migration tasks,
building interfaces to consume Sitefinity, custom content entry
interfaces or just about anything you can visualize.
